# EIDF Documentation

The Edinburgh International Data Facility (EIDF) is built and operated by
[EPCC](https://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk) at [the University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk).
EIDF is a place to store, find and work with data of all kinds. You
can find more information on the service and the research it supports on
the [EIDF website](https://www.ed.ac.uk/edinburgh-international-data-facility/).

This repository contains the documentation for the service and is linked
