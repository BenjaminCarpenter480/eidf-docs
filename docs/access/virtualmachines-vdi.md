# Virtual Machines (VMs) and the EIDF Virtual Desktop Interface (VDI)

Using the EIDF VDI, members of EIDF projects can connect to VMs that they have been granted access to. The EIDF VDI is
a web portal that displays the connections to VMs a user has available to them, and then those connections can be easily
initiated by clicking on them in the user interface. Once connected to the target VM, all interactions are mediated
through the user's web browser by the EIDF VDI.

## Login to the EIDF VDI

Once your membership request to join the appropriate EIDF project has been approved, you will be able to login to the
EIDF VDI at [https://eidf-vdi.epcc.ed.ac.uk/vdi](https://eidf-vdi.epcc.ed.ac.uk/vdi).

Authentication to the VDI is provided by SAFE, so if you do not have an active web browser session in SAFE,
you will be redirected to the [SAFE log on page](https://safe.epcc.ed.ac.uk).
If you do not have a SAFE account follow the instructions in the
[SAFE documentation](https://epcced.github.io/safe-docs/safe-for-users/)
how to register and receive your password.


## Navigating the EIDF VDI

After you have been authenticated through SAFE and logged into the EIDF VDI, if you have multiple connections available
to you that have been associated with your user (typically in the case of research projects), you will be presented with
the VDI home screen as shown below

## Connecting to a VM

If you have only one connection associated with your VDI user account (typically in the case of workshops), you will be
automatically connected to the target VM's virtual desktop. Once you are connected to the VM, you will be asked for your
username and password as shown below (if you are participating in a workshop, then you may not be asked for credentials)

Once your credentials have been accepted, you will be connected to your VM's desktop environment. For instance, the
screenshot below shows a resulting connection to a Xubuntu 20.04 VM with the Xfce desktop environment.
