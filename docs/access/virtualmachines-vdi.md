# Virtual Machines (VMs) and the EIDF Virtual Desktop Interface (VDI)

Using the EIDF VDI, members of EIDF projects can connect to VMs that they have been granted access to. The EIDF VDI is
a web portal that displays the connections to VMs a user has available to them, and then those connections can be easily
initiated by clicking on them in the user interface. Once connected to the target VM, all interactions are mediated
through the user's web browser by the EIDF VDI.

## Accessing

In order to access the EIDF VDI and connect to EIDF data science cloud VMs, you need to have an active
[SAFE](https://safe.epcc.ed.ac.uk) account. If you already have a SAFE account, you can skip ahead to the
[Request Project Membership](#request-project-membership) instructions. Otherwise, follow the
[Register Account in EPCC SAFE](#register-safe-account) instructions immediately below to create the account.

### <a id="register-safe-account"></a>Register Account in EPCC SAFE
1. Go to [SAFE signup](https://safe.epcc.ed.ac.uk/signup.jsp) and complete the registration form
    1. Mandatory fields are: Email, Nationality, First name, Last name, Institution for reporting, Department, and Gender
    2. Your Email should be the one you used to register for the EIDF service (or Ed-DaSH workshop)
    3. Institution for reporting should always be 'University of Edinburgh'
    4. Department should always be '**EIDF**'

on the next page
