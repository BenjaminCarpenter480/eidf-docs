# Accessing

In order to access the EIDF VDI and connect to EIDF data science cloud VMs, you need to have an active
[SAFE](https://safe.epcc.ed.ac.uk) account. If you already have a SAFE account, you can skip ahead to the
[Request Project Membership](#step-2-request-project-membership) instructions. Otherwise, follow the
[Register Account in EPCC SAFE](#step-1-register-account-in-epcc-safe) instructions immediately below to create the
account.
