### New VMs and VDI connections

My project manager gave me access to a VM but the connection doesn't show up in the VDI connections list?

This may happen when a machine/VM was added to your connections list while you were logged in to the VDI. Please refresh the connections list by logging out and logging in again, and the new connections should appear.
