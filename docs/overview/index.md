# A Unique Service for Academia and Industry

The Edinburgh International Data Facility (EIDF) is a growing set of
data and compute services developed to support the [Data Driven
Innovation Programme](https://ddi.ac.uk/) at the University of Edinburgh.

Its goal is to support learners, researchers and innovators across
the spectrum, with services from data discovery through simple
learn-as-you-play-with-data notebooks to GPU-enabled machine-learning
platforms for driving AI application development.



## EIDF and the Data-Driven Innovation Initiative

Launched at the end of 2018, the Data-Driven Innovation (DDI)
programme is one of six funded within the Edinburgh & South-East
Scotland City Region Deal. The DDI programme aims to make Edinburgh
the “Data Capital of Europe”, with ambitious targets to support,
enhance and improve talent, research, commercial adoption and
entrepreneurship across the region through better use of data.

The programme targets ten industry sectors, with interactions managed
through five DDI Hubs: the Bayes Centre, the Usher Institute,
Edinburgh Futures Institute, the National Robotarium, and Easter
Bush. The activities of these Hubs are underpinned by EIDF.
