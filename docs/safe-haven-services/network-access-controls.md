# Safe Haven Network Access Controls

The TRE Safe Haven services are protected against open, global access by IPv4 source address filtering. These network access controls ensure that connections are permitted only from Safe Haven controller partner networks and collaborating research institutions. 

The network access controls are managed by the Safe Haven service controllers who instruct EPCC to add and remove the IPv4 addresses allowed to connect to the service gateway. Researchers must connect to the Safe Haven service by first connecting to their institution or corporate VPN and then connecting to the Safe Haven.

The Safe Haven IG controller and research project co-ordination teams must submit and confirm IPv4 address filter changes to their service help desk via email.
