# Data Publishing

## Assumptions

The EIDF guarantees to the best of its ability to continue its services until at least the 31-Mar-2032 and aims to continue beyond 2032 subject to funding. However, should we have to terminate the service we will give you at least 3 months notice to retrieve your data. It is important to keep your contact details up to date. The publishing service is not an archiving service and we would recommend where possible that you have a backup version of your data. We reserve the right to remove any data at the end of service provision.

Here are some basic assumptions - if these do not match your expectations then please let us know.

* To qualify for the free data publishing service your data must be open and freely available to all. If you want to control access to your data you will have to use the [S3 service](https://epcced.github.io/eidf-docs/services/s3/) instead which is not a free service.
* Let us know what you expect your final data volume to be. If you are going to be generating data additions then let us know what you expect your addition rate will be. 
* If you have any other explicit requirements for your data do let us know.
