# Data Publishing

## Assumptions

The EIDF guarantees to the best of its ability to continue its services until at least the 31-Mar-2032 and aims to continue beyond 2032 subject to funding. However, should we have to terminate the service we will give you at least 3 months notice to retrieve your data. It is important to keep your contact details up to date. The publishing service is not an archiving service and we would recommend where possible that you have a backup version of your data. We reserve the right to remove any data at the end of service provision.

Here are some basic assumptions - 

* You already have created a [SAFE](https://safe.epcc.ed.ac.uk/) account and can access the [EIDF portal](https://portal.eidf.ac.uk/). Please do this before proceeding.
* To qualify for the free data publishing service your data must be open and freely available to all. If you want to control access to your data you will have to use the [S3 service](https://epcced.github.io/eidf-docs/services/s3/) instead which is not a free service.

## Apply for a project

You will need to apply for an EIDF data project which is slightly different from other EIDF project applications. Be aware that data publishing is free subject to your data volumes being under a given threshold, we will be in touch if you requirements are higher than this, and that the data is being made freely available.  

> [!NOTE]
>
> It would be good to point out differences for data project applications.

In the EIDF portal:

* Press on the `Your project applications` link. 
* Press on the `New Application` link and put in an application for us to host your data. 
  * You will be asked to supply a name for your project.
  * A start date (when you hope to start publishing your data).
  * A proposed end date (at the moment you will not be able to go beyond 31-Dec-2032).

For the EIDF Services you require chose the "*ingest data formally into EIDF for long-term hosting*" choice. Note that all the other EIDF services have a [cost](https://edinburgh-international-data-facility.ed.ac.uk/access) so, if you add any other EIDF services a charge will be imposed. The data publishing will have a cost if you go over a threshold - we will get in touch if you pass this threshold.

Be sure to describe the dataset(s) that you wish to ingest. Submit your application. Your application will be reviewed and you will be notified if your project has been approved or rejected - someone may be in touch to clarify points in your application.
