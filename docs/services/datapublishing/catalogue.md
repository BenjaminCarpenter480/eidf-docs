## Customising your entry in the EIDF Data Catalogue

When/if your project is approved, an organisation will be created on the EIDF data catalogue (an instance of CKAN version 2.10.4 ([CKAN user documentation](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.10/user-guide.html))). You can customise your organisation information (we map EIDF projects to CKAN organisations). The EIDF catalogue:

* [https://catalogue.eidf.ac.uk/](https://catalogue.eidf.ac.uk/)

Login using your SAFE credentials - there is a "Log in" on the top right.

**Note**

* **Do NOT use the CKAN interface to create Datasets** - the data ingest process creates these for you and associates S3 links with your data. You can provide additional metadata once the Dataset records are in CKAN. Please do not add datasets through the CKAN interface either. Contact us if would like anything removed.
