# Data Publishing

## Applying for a project

If you do not already have an EPCC SAFE account, you will need to create an account before proceeding:

* [https://safe.epcc.ed.ac.uk/](https://safe.epcc.ed.ac.uk/)

Once you have a SAFE account, go to the EIDF portal and use your SAFE credentials to login.

* [https://portal.eidf.ac.uk/](https://portal.eidf.ac.uk/])

First, apply for an EIDF project. If you already have an existing EIDF project from which you want to do the data publishing you do not need to apply for a new project instead submit your queries via our [EIDF Helpdesk](https://portal.eidf.ac.uk/queries/submit). State that you would like to publish data from your existing project and let us know your project identifier is, e.g. eidfNNN, and the volume of data that you want to publish. Be aware that data publishing is free subject to your data volumes being under a given threshold, we will be in touch if you requirements are higher than this, and that the data is being made freely available.  

If you do not have an existing EIDF project, in the EIDF portal:

* Press on the `Your project applications` link. 
* Press on the `New Application` link and put in an application for us to host your data. 
  * You will be asked to supply a name for your project.
  * A start date (when you hope to start publishing your data).
  * A proposed end date (at the moment you will not be able to go beyond 31-Dec-2032).


For the EIDF Services you require chose the "*ingest data formally into EIDF for long-term hosting*" choice. Note that all the other EIDF services have a [cost](https://edinburgh-international-data-facility.ed.ac.uk/access) so, if you add any other EIDF services a charge will be imposed. The data publishing will have a cost if you go over a threshold - we will get in touch if you pass this threshold.

Be sure to describe the dataset(s) that you wish to ingest. Submit your application. Your application will be reviewed and you will be notified if your project has been approved or rejected - someone may be in touch to clarify points in your application.
