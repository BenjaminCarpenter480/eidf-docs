# Overview

The EIDF S3 Service is an object store with an interface that is compatible with a subset of the Amazon S3 RESTful API.

## Service Access

Users should have an EIDF account as described in [EIDF Accounts](../../access/project.md).

Project leads can request an object store allocation through a request to the EIDF helpdesk.
